# sParkTower

## Electronic Vehicle charging & parking tower

 This project is making parking tower charging electronic vehicles. Most of electronic vehicles can not use parking tower because the vehicles weight is too heavy. However recently people is growing using that vehicles so we decieded to make parking tower for electronic vehicles. This tower has auto chargers. When a car is entered this tower that car is parked in charging area and charged by the auto chargers. After charging this car is moved to parking area and waiting for the car owner's payment. When the car owner pay, the car is moved to exit.
